Wrote my (unfortunate) [blog](https://github.com/SammyShehter/blogue_v3) until I found [this](https://deno.land/x/blog) solution.
I think I'll explore this repository and try to contribute to in it.
Contacted one of the participants, I hope my contribution will be useful.
In general, Deno pleasantly surprised.

What I like the most is that it uses .md markup
